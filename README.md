# Dummy Utility Apps Explorer
This is the code for a dummy non-GUI utility apps explorer which I created in G-10.
Since this code was written in 2014 and is static, some of the facts and figures used in the portions of the code might not be updated.
Also, the code has some minor issues (not exactly bugs, but some features which can be improved). For example, in some cases where required input is numeric and the given input is alpha-numeric, it throws an exception instead of handling it.
